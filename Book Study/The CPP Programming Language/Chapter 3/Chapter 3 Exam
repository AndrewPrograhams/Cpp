1. Code a class to represent a complex type. Overload its basic arithmetic operators. Define it's +=, etc. operators.
-Use doubles as its real and imaginary parts
-Make three constructors, none provided parts should be initialized to 0.
    -Real and imaginary parts provided
    -Real provided
    -Neither provdied

2. Add the following functionality to the Vector container class defined thus far. Assume push_back has been defined elsewhere.
-A working destructor
-Initialize all elements of the container to 0
-A read(&istream s) function that sets values based on user input. Assume a default constructor for v exists. Comment out this code.
-A constructor that initializes from a {}-type expression. Use inlining to define this constructor. Use the copy() function from <algorithm>

3. Code the following classes, Shape, Triangle, Square, Circle, and Smiley. Use proper abstraction.
-include interface functions for rotation, draw,
