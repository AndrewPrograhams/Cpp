1. Simple vector with exceptions. 

Define a header and cpp file that defines a vector. The vector should have a size and should keep track of an array of doubles.
You need only define the following operations.

Constructor
Operator[]
Size

Consider invariants and throw exceptions where appropriate.
Use static assertion to ensure that the size of doubles matches the expected value of 8.

2. Simple Traffic Light Enumeration

Define a header and cpp file for an enumeration called traffic light. It should have green, yellow, and red as its enums.
You need only define the following operations

Operator++
Operator--
Operator==
Operator!=

Use header guards to prevent redefinition.
